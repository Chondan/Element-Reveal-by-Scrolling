        Venice, Italian Venezia, city, major seaport, and capital of both the provincia (province) of Venezia 
        and the regione (region) of Veneto, northern Italy. An island city, it was once the centre of a maritime republic. 
        It was the greatest seaport in late medieval Europe and the continent‚Äôs commercial and cultural link to Asia. 
        Venice is unique environmentally, architecturally, and historically, 
        and in its days as a republic the city was styled la serenissima (‚Äúthe most serene‚Äù or ‚Äúsublime‚Äù). 
        It remains a major Italian port in the northern Adriatic Sea and is one of the world‚Äôs oldest tourist and cultural centres.
        Since the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797, the city has held an unrivaled place in the Western imagination and has 
        been endlessly described in prose and verse. The luminous spectacle of ornate marbled and frescoed palaces, bell towers, 
        and domes reflected in the sparkling waters of the lagoon under a blue Adriatic sky has been painted, photographed, 
        and filmed to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish the real city from its romantic representations. 
        The visitor arriving in Venice is still transported into another world, one whose atmosphere and beauty remain incomparable.

        At the top of most travelers' bucket lists, the northern lights (also known as the aurora borealis) is nature's most dazzling light show. But even for the most well-traveled, this phenomenon can be difficult to come by, so how exactly can you track it down?
        Hard to spot at the best of times, aurora hunters might have heard that this year the sun is almost about to enter the Solar Minimum phase. This means the northern lights will be dimmer and occur less frequently over the next decade, with 2019 and 2020 marking the lowest point. 
        However, it doesn't mean that the lights will fade completely. Contrary to some of the more defeatist rumors, aurora watchers won‚Äôt have to bid farewell to the northern lights as the Solar Minimum takes place, but the importance of your location will become especially vital for your auroral viewing. Here's a quick guide for northern light explorers.

        Mi piace stupirmi. Questo l‚Äôho capito da un bel pezzo. Che √® ben diverso dal ricevere sorprese (quelle non mi creano entusiasmo)‚û°Ô∏è(non amo le cose inaspettate). Stupirsi invece significa essere rapito. Avere occhi üëÄ , mente üß† e cuore ‚ù§Ô∏è completamente catturati e impegnati a provare un‚Äôemozione che in quel preciso istante. E non capirci pi√π nulla. Questo mi piace, eccome!!! E la maggior parte delle volte mi √® capitato in montagna dove le ‚Äúalte signore‚Äù dominano lo spazio intorno a te. Rimango catturato dalla grandezza e se pur a scuola ho studiato come si forma e di cosa √® fatta una montagna, rimane ancora un mistero per me che possano esistere cose cos√¨ grandi e belle (vi prego, lasciatemi vivere questa piccola sana ‚Äúignoranza‚Äù!). Forse le montagne pi√π belle le ho viste in #Nepal come l‚Äô #Annapurna in foto, ma anche durante i miei voli Roma -Parigi mi stupivo sorvolando le nostre Alpi. E per agosto come da programma pre-Covid dovrei fare trekking nel Pamir il massiccio dell‚ÄôAsia centrale. Ci riuscir√≤? Non sapete quando lo stia aspettando! ‚û°Ô∏è Davanti a cosa invece riuscite a stupirvi? üëâüèª Raccontatemelo #mountain #trekking #hiking #mountainscape #travelmore #traveldeeper #travelgoals #traveltips #travelstoke #traveladdict #traveldiary #travelinspo #travelinspiration #vacationtime #beautifulnature #theimaged #artofvisuals #adventuretime #adventurer #adventureisoutthere #adventureawaits #adventureseeker #viaggiareancora #viaggiaresempre #volgo #lonelyplanet #manolorufini #shakeyourfreelife

        Kashmir Great Lakes Trek is one of the most beautiful treks in India. This trek is located above Sonamarg (or Sonmarg), which lies on the Srinagar-Leh highway just before the Zozila Pass.The true beauty of Kashmir lies in the hidden valleys that are not accessible by road. Until a few years ago this trek was also not accessible to civilians and has innumerable beautiful alpine lakes throughout its trails. It takes around eight days to do this trek, but the vistas leave you with memories that would last a lifetime, and since it‚Äôs a moderate level trek, it can be taken up by fit but amateur trekkers or even some first timers.

        Many of the lakes on this trek are named after gods from Hindu mythology and come with interesting stories about the origin and existence. The most spectacular lakes on this trek are Gangabal, Vishansar, Krishnasar and Gadsar.
